## Resources
You can find the latest version number (and the implementation details) at the [Dairy Foundation](https://repo.dairy.foundation/#/releases/org/solverslib/core), where SolversLib is hosted.

Javadocs for SolversLib Core (standard FTCLib, has Command Base, Hardware, Gamepads, etc.) are available at <https://repo.dairy.foundation/javadoc/releases/org/solverslib/core/latest>, but you can replace `latest` with the desired version number.


Javadocs for SolversLib Pedro Pathing (Pedro Pathing support in FTCLib) are available at <https://repo.dairy.foundation/javadoc/releases/org/solverslib/pedroPathing/latest>, but you can replace `latest` with the desired version number.

The best documentation for SolversLib is the Javadocs, especially for the Pedro Pathing support.

FTCLib documentation (has information about how to use FTCLib, and does not have any information about SolversLib) - <https://docs.ftclib.org/ftclib>

Please note that the vision part of FTCLib has been removed in SolversLib, as it is severly outdated. If you want vision, please use EasyOpenCV (which is built into the SDK).

## Installing SolversLib

1. Open up your FTC SDK Project in Android Studio.

2. Go to your `build.common.gradle` file in your project.

    ![BuildCommonGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/build-common-gradle.png)
    
3. Add the following to the `repositories` section at the bottom of the file.

   ```groovy
   mavenCentral()
   ```
    
4. Open the `build.gradle` file in your TeamCode module. 
    
    ![TeamCodeGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/teamcode-gradle.png)
    
5. Go to the bottom of the file, and add the following.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation "org.solverslib:core:0.2.1"
        // the vision part of ftclib is no longer in solverslib, as it is extremely old
        // please use EasyOpenCV instead

        // Only for pedro pathing users (you still need the actual pedro pathing library installed for this):
        implementation "org.solverslib:pedroPathing:0.2.1"
    }
    ```

You can find the latest version number at the [Dairy Foundation](https://repo.dairy.foundation/#/releases/org/solverslib/core), where SolversLib is hosted.
Alternatively, you can look at the latest [tag](https://github.com/FTC-23511/SolversLib/tags).

Both the `core` and `pedroPathing` modules use the same version.

6. Because FTCLib makes use of advanced features, you need to increase the minSdkVersion to 24. Unfortunately, this means that ZTE Speed Phones are not supported in this release.

In build.common.gradle, change the minSdkVersion from 23 to 24:
```groovy

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 28
    }
```
7. Ensure your Java version is set to 8. This should already be the case with the latest SDK.
If not, you will need to change your Java version. Scroll down in `build.common.gradle` until you find the `compileOptions` block.
```groovy
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
}
```
Change the 7 to an 8 like so:
```groovy
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```
    
8. Perform a gradle sync to implement your changes.

__NOTE:__ If your module has a few dependencies, you might have an error related to multidex on building the project.
This is caused by the project exceeding the limit for imports enforced by Android Studio. To solve this, 
add `multiDexEnabled true` to the below location inside the `build.common.gradle` file.

```groovy

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'
        minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion 28


        multiDexEnabled true
    }
```
